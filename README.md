# Project: Investigate a Dataset (TMDb_Movies Dataset)

## Introduction

<p> This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.</p>
<p>● Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.</p>
<p>● There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.</p>
<p>● The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.</p>

</ol>

## Limitations
<ul>
<li>I had to drop so many rows because they were filled with missing values.</li>
<li>I noticed columns like budget and revenue had no currency unit. I think that there isa difffernt movies might have a budget with different currency unit.</li> 
<li>I added columns like "profit _earned" and "genre" to answer some questions.</li>     
</ul>
